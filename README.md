# CINDER-OPERATORR

The cinder-operator is an OpenShift Operator built using the Operator Framework
for Go. The Operator provides a way to easily install and manage an OpenStack
Cinder service on OpenShift. This Operator was developed using RDO containers
for openStack but is not limited to them.

Conceptually there are 2 types of nodes: Control Plane Nodes, running OpenStack
control plane services on OpenShift, and External Data Plane (EDPM) Nodes,
running RHEL for computes (and maybe swift).

## Getting Started

In this section we'll deploy an operator deployed OpenStack system with a
single compute node and using the LVM backend for block storage. The control
plane will run in a single node OpenShift cluster inside a VM and the compute
node will be a single EDPM node in another VM.

Cloning this repository is not necessary to follow this getting started
section, though it will be for development.

**You need to get your [pull-secrets from Red Hat](
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/create/local) and store it in the machine,
for example on your home directory as `pull-secret`.**

Ensure prerequisites are installed:

```sh
sudo dnf -y install git make wget ansible-core
git clone https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls.git
```

Get the OpenShift cluster up and running:

```sh
cd install_yamls/devsetup

PULL_SECRET=~/pull-secret CPUS=6 MEMORY=24576 DISK=50 make download_tools crc

make crc_attach_default_interface
```

Install the OpenStack operators:

```sh
eval $(crc oc-env)
cd ..
make crc_storage openstack_wait
```

Create the deployment config for the LVM backend and deploy the OpenStack
control plane:

```sh
oc kustomize \
  https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/cinder-operator.git/config/samples/backends/lvm/iscsi?ref=main \
  > ~/openstack-deployment.yaml

oc label node --all openstack.org/cinder-lvm=

OPENSTACK_CR=~/openstack-deployment.yaml make openstack_deploy
```

*NOTE*: We are using `--all` to label all the nodes because we only have 1 node
in our OpenShift cluster. For 3 node cluster a node name must be provided
instead.

This will reboot the OpenShift cluster, so it will take a while to be up and
running.

```sh
oc wait --for condition=Ready --timeout=300s
```

Create the EDPM (compute) VM and provisioning:

```sh
cd devsetup
make edpm_compute

cd ..
DATAPLANE_TIMEOUT=40m make edpm_wait_deploy
```

We should now have a working OpenStack deployment and we will be able to run
commands using the `openstackclient` pod:

```sh
oc exec -t openstackclient -- openstack volume service list
oc exec -t openstackclient -- openstack compute service list
```

## Troubleshooting

### Failure creating PVs

Running `make crc_storage openstack_wait` may fail creating the PVs. It is safe
to just retry the command.

Or we can clean existing PVs with `make crc_storage_cleanup` and retry.

### Timeout deploying EDPM

Running `DATAPLANE_TIMEOUT=40m make edpm_wait_deploy` usually fails due to a
timeout.

You can `watch oc get OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` until it is ready and then
run `make edpm_nova_discover_hosts`.

### Problems deploying EDPM

We can see the pods that are running ansible playbooks to configure the
compute node with `oc get pod -l app=openstackansibleee --watch` and the do an
`oc logs` on a specific pod.

We can also check the logs filtering by label:
```sh
oc logs -f -l app=openstackansibleee
```

Or we can also run a complex command to log the different pods automatically:

```sh
while true; do oc logs -n openstack -f $(oc get pod -l osdpd=openstack-edpm --field-selector='status.phase=Running' --no-headers -o name) 2>/dev/null || echo -n .; sleep 1; done
```

### Go into the EDPM node:

```sh
ssh -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@192.168.122.100
```

Once provisioned cloud-admin user will exist.

### Go into the OpenShift node

```sh
oc debug $(oc get node -o name)
chroot /host
```
